  Our project is an interactive Perlin Noise generator. It displays
  on the screen a variety of visually stunning grayscale and colored patterns,
  building up each noise generation block by block. Users can select through
  clicking the numerous buttons the exact visual noise generation that they want
  to see, from fractal noise, to colored landscapes, woody textures, and more.
  Everything is on screen, allowing for the user to simply click a button,
  and a random noise visualization will be generated every time.
